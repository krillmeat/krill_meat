# KRILL MEAT
This is my personal website for my illustration

## FEATURES
This page utilized quite a bit of different JS to make things work. The page itself has a lot of built-in JS, but I also built some custom Plugins to make things happen:

**MOBILE SWIPE :**  I built a basic JS swipe functionality for the mobile version of the site.

**SVG MANAGER :** Because I wanted to have the SVGs be dynamically loaded, I built a manager for that. It matches SVG elements in the HTML to an SVG JS Object, and fills them in appropriately
